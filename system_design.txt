we need to be able to send the move information from the server to handle_client

essentially, this is all we're doing, sending this information from one end to the other

whats the most effective way to be able to have valid moves? especially for a minimax AI?

bugs to fix:
- knight can take own pieces
- checkmate
- move legality as a whole?


Piece:
- each piece has certain legal moves; get legal moves()  
- is it the players turn?, can you move the piece? is_movable
- is the piece selected? select, deselect -> what constraints are there that would make a piece selectable?
- each piece should have a member list of legal moves

cell:
- is the cell empty?
- if not, what piece is in it?

board:
- comprised of cells 
- is this the game engine? -> probably should move the engine away from the board, since the board is an object

screen:
- holds the board
- tells whose move it is
- tracks time, and move number?

engine:
- the rules
