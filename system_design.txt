we need to be able to send the move information from the server to handle_client

essentially, this is all we're doing, sending this information from one end to the other

whats the most effective way to be able to have valid moves? especially for a minimax AI?

bugs to fix:
- knight can take own pieces
- checkmate
- move legality as a whole?
